## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently enrolled in a mobile app and development course, which is requiring me to create a GitHub profile. I will be documenting my coding experience. 

I've dibbled and dabbled (LOL) in native React App development, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML so far. Again, I'm far from an expert.
